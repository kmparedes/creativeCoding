Over the past two weeks, my goal was to create a version of the popular Snake Game. However, instead of interaction between food and snake, a third object was introduced that would interact with both. In the last week, I was able to complete the interactions between organisms, apple, and snake, as well create multiple instances of the snake object. As it eats more apples, the organism with change shape, going from baby, to child, to adult, and gains "points." If the snake comes in contact with the organism, it results in a loss of points, as well as the snake multiplying.
